### Trusting the Unverified App

Upon first use, you'll see a warning due to Google's unverified app status. Here's how to bypass:

1. **Warning Screen**: Encounter a warning upon authorization attempt.

   After clicking **Advanced**, select "COMP 3610: Assignment #1 Submission Portal (unsafe)" to continue.

3. **Grant Permissions**: Review and click **Allow** if you agree with the permissions.

4. **Completion**: Post-permission, you're redirected back, now fully authorized.

**Why This Happens**: Google mandates a verification process for app security. Until verified, warnings protect against potential harm.
